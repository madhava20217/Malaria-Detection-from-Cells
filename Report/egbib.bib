abstract = {Malaria remains a major burden on global health, with roughly 200 million cases worldwide and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Besides biomedical research and political efforts, modern information technology is playing a key role in many attempts at fighting the disease. One of the barriers toward a successful mortality reduction has been inadequate malaria diagnosis in particular. To improve diagnosis, image analysis software and machine learning methods have been used to quantify parasitemia in microscopic blood slides. This article gives an overview of these techniques and discusses the current developments in image analysis and machine learning for microscopic malaria diagnosis. We organize the different approaches published in the literature according to the techniques used for imaging, image preprocessing, parasite detection and cell segmentation, feature computation, and automatic cell classification. Readers will find the different techniques listed in tables, with the relevant articles cited next to them, for both thin and thick blood smear images. We also discussed the latest developments in sections devoted to deep learning and smartphone technology for future malaria diagnosis.}

title = {Determination of Hue Saturation Value (HSV) color feature in kidney histology image},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The kidney is organ that plays an important role in the bodyâ€™s metabolism, especially the process of filtration and reabsorption of food waste. Currently the determination of kidney parts through kidney histology is still done manually by experts based on experience and knowledge. Therefore, to make it easier to determine the parts of the kidney, a histological image segmentation of the kidney was carried out. In the segmentation process, it is necessary to extract the color features of the parts of the kidney, namely the glomerulus and proximal tubule. The color features used are Hue, saturation, value (HSV) color space. The hue means the representation of color type. The saturation defines the amount of white color is mixed with hue. The value in HSV color space denotes the intensity or lightness or brightness of the color. The method consists of three steps such as pre-processing step, extraction feature HSV and statistical analysis. The result of statistical analysis showed that the hue and value features, glomerulus and proximal tubule had different ranges of values. However, the features of saturation, glomerulus and proximal tubule is overlap.}
